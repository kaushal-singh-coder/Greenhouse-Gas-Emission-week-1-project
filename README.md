Greenhouse Gas Emissions â€“ Week 1 Project

This project analyzes and visualizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the 2015 Supply Chain Emission Factors for US Industries and Commodities dataset.

Project Structure:

- main.py                  â†’ Python script to clean and visualize data
- cleaned_emissions.csv    â†’ Cleaned dataset (nulls & duplicates removed)
- top10_barplot.png        â†’ Bar chart showing top 10 industries by emissions
- emission_histogram.png   â†’ Histogram showing emission distribution

Tasks Completed (Week 1):

- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Removed rows with null values in 'Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins'
- Removed duplicate rows
- Grouped emissions by 'Industry Name'
- Visualized:
  â€¢ Top 10 industries by emissions (barplot)
  â€¢ Emission distribution (histogram)

Technologies Used:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

How to Run:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Run main.py:
   python main.py
3. Outputs:
   - cleaned_emissions.csv
   - top10_barplot.png
   - emission_histogram.png

Status:

âœ… Week 1 Completed  
ðŸ“Œ Ready for Week 2
